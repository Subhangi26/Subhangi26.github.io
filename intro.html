                <h1>Hi there!</h1>
                <p>Welcome to you my Portfolio. Here, I added my Resume, personal projects, basic intro, and contact details.
                    In my Resume, you will find all my details, python<br> & frontend projects and you can easily download it from my Portfolio.
                    I added 3 starting or simple projects in this, all are based on HTML, CSS & Javascript.<br> The first project is the simplest 
                    one, the car-moving project: You can see the car tyres moving with background (like clouds, trees) & car  sounds. The second <br>
                    project is the Spotify page, similar to or copy of the original Spotify music application. Here, you can play/pause the audio, 
                    and change the  song. The third<br> project is the travel website, where you can see how to log in, contact, and do bookings. A beautiful 
                    gallery is also available with the picture & description. I<br> also mentioned how the offer looks, and about the page look. 
                    Many parts are still incomplete because I am still learning and gaining. I want to work on a good<br> project to lighten up my 
                    skills. I am working on HTML, CSS, Javascript & Reactjs. I am planning to work on Frontend projects which use Reactjs as a framework.
                    <br> I also worked on Figma tool, Python, Big data & Oracle, like I'm experiencing everything. I update my website weekly.
                    I am currently working in Infosys as a <br> System Engineer. I live in Noida, India.
